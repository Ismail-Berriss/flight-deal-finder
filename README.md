# flight-deal-finder
This program uses the Kiwi API to search for flights deals for the next 6 months, and compares them to a list of cities and flight prices in a Google Sheet with the Sheety API, then send an SMS, with the Twilio API, to your phone. This is part of the capstone project of Day 39 from Angula Yu's Python course.
